## Deep learning Project

### [2019|present]  TensorFlow Framework 
 
    1. Classification of Image digits with SVHN dataset. [github demo]
	
	2. Classification of fashion article images using a __custom model with custom layers__
	(Residual Network). [github demo]
	
    3. Classification of satellite images using EuroSAT dataset 
	(including residential, industrial, highway, river, forest, etc images)
	
    4. Pet Classification using Transfer learning with Dogs vs Cats dataset
	(2013 Kaggle competition).
	
    5. Scene Classification on LSUN dataset and CIFAR-100 dataset 
	(with a focus on Tensorflow and Keras data processing tools)
	
    6. Implementing the neural style transfer (NST) algorithm and
	Generating novel artistic images.


#### [2017/18]  Pytorch Framework 
 
	1. Detection of Morphed Face Images using Deep learning. 
	This project was doneby Pytorch framework (Academic projrct)
	
    2. People counting using UCSD Pedestrian dataset with deep learning 
	approach,2017. (The project is part of Computer Vision proseminar course).

	
## Projects with classical approach

	1. Finger Vein classification based on texture descriptors and standard ML. (2019)
	
	2. Classification and Detection of spoof images (2018)
	
	3. PRNU-based finger vein sensor identification. (2018)
	
	4. Survey on effect of various compression techniques on texture classification. (207/18
